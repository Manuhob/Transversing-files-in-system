# Transversing-files-in-system
This is an exercise to write scripts on python to read and display files of the system.

## The specifics

The script searches for pdf files on the given directory, whose size is larger than 0.01 Mb and prints the first 20 results in the left first order.

## How to use it

Just run the script in the command line of the terminal as

`python3 pdf_finder.py 'path'`

where 'path' is the directory we will transverse. As an example of this, we can run it on the Dropbox directory as

`python3 pdf_finder.py /home/manu/Dropbox`
